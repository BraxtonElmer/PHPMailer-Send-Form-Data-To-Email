# PHPMailer Send Form Data To Email
Here is the full code for sending a mail with the form data a user inputted in a webpage!<br>
This mail sends with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPMailer">PHPMailer Library</a>.<br>
Before starting to configure the settings and personalizing the form, read this whole file to understand how it works so there would not be any problems with the mailing.<br>
In order to send the form data to an email, first an email account must be created, the mail will be sent from this account to another reciepient.<br>
Here we are going to use Gmail as our sender account.<br>
### Step 1 - Create a Gmail Account 
You can create a Google account from <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup?hl=en">here</a>.<br>
Make sure you save or remember the mail address and password as this is required to log and send the Form Date to the recieving mail address (Which is done by PHP).<br>
### Step 2 - Change Security Settings of Google Account
After an account is created successfully, go to the Google account settings of the Account you just created and go to the Security tab in the left side or you can <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security">click here to go there</a> (Make sure you are in the security settings of the account you just created).<br>
Make sure 2-Step Verification is Off and also turn off "Use your Phone to sign in".<br>
